# Purpose of this app

This is a practice app that will be built using React to solidify the things I learn. 

I will start with the basic syntaxes that I know, rather than adding shortcuts, so I get to know how to debug and solve issues. 

### Jokes API
In the spirit of the `Vlad joke` I will be making a Dad Joke generator, using the `icanhazdadjoke` API.

### Features
- Random Joke 
  - Render a selection of random jokes

- Search for a joke by word
  - Let user type a keyword to search for a joke
  - i.e `cat` will show jokes with the word `cat` in them.

- Let a user "Like" a joke
  - Keep track of the number of likes a joke has

- Let users "favorite" a joke
  - These favourited jokes will appear in their own list, for them to see at a later date

### Advanced feature ideas
- Login to sumbit their own jokes
  - Pubslih jokes pending review

- Cartoon Jokes
  - Find a cartoon joke API, or allow users to submit image based jokes.
